# wARP

An APP that scan the local network.
Though Despite it's name. One can't really send ARP in unrooted android device.
So it's just a simple network scanner based on ping.

NOTICE: This is a "homework" project. Therefore I suggest you only use it
for learning (if you can find anything useful here).

## Features

Very simple. You open the app. Choose one network interface.
On the right upper corner. And swipe up. Then its done.

Currently only Android's backend really works.
The Linux backend despite works before. 
But after the redo of the frontend and backend communication.
It's not working anymore. There are no plans to fix it for now.
